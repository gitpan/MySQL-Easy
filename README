MySQL::Easy
=======================

BLURB

This module is really just a collection of handy shortcuts that
the author uses frequently.  It probably had no business ever
ending up on CPAN at all, but since serveral people use it
(including but not limited to the author), he decided to
definitely keep it on CPAN.

It Automagically reads your .my.cnf (if any) and handles all the
connections in the usual way.  There are a few other nice little
shortcuts, but this is the gist of it.

EXAMPLE

my $dbo = new MySQL::Easy("databasename"); 
my $sth = $dbo->ready("select * from some_table");

execute $sth or die $dbo->errstr;
